# Project 7 - WordPress Pentesting

Time spent: **10* hours spent in total

5 for setup, 5 for expoiting

> Objective: Find, analyze, recreate, and document **five vulnerabilities** affecting an old version of WordPress

## Pentesting Report

1. Weak Use Enumeration Protection
  - [ ] Summary: All registered users to the WP site are checked for and listed by the WPScan tool. Even better, the tool will note that default user names are in use, which may lead to default passwords also still being utilized. Having a full list of active users could lead to an easy login for a hacker. Weak passwords are common enough that if a site had dozens of users, one is bound to give away a login. 
    - Vulnerability types: User Enumeration
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: From my research, there is no obvious fix provided by WP. Instead, there are third party addons that can help prevnent User Enumeration. Even still, these have been exploited by hackers and require their own patching. Thus far, the only fix is to change the source code for how WP handles users. Although I don't quite understand how or why it works, this is some code that will change how WP handles users, and will prevent user enumeration.
     
      change in: .htaccess:
      ```
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/wp-admin [NC]
      RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} author=\d
      RewriteRule ^ - [L,R=403]
      ```
      AND/OR
      ```
      RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/wp-admin [NC]
      RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^author=\d+ [NC,OR]
      RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^author=\{num 
      RewriteRule ^ - [L,R=403]
      ```

  - [ ] Steps to recreate: in Kali terminal enter
  ```
  "wpscan --url http://wpdistillery.vm --enumerate utp"
  ```
  - [ ] Affected source code: unknown
    
2. Easy Website Fingerprinting; Exposed Version #
  - [ ] Summary: The readme file for the WP site is exposed by default. Within the file is the version number of WP. Although the WPScan tool finds this easily, a user that wants to check without booting Kali or using tools can very simply check for a readme file. Once the version number is found, a simple internet search will net all possible vulns in that version number. Doing all of this without using Kali or WPScan makes for an even easier barrier of entry for any hacker to attack the WP site. 
    - Vulnerability types: Version Number Exposure
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: Not Fixed. Admins must force the readme files content to be changed or remove access to the page. 
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trezzan/RepoBoi/master/ReadMe.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: Any WP site that is known to be Wordpress: add the text
  '''
  /readme.html
  '''
  at the end. This will show the readme file and the correspondeing version number. 
  - [ ] Affected source code: unknown

3. Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - [ ] Summary: The script executed would normally not affect the site. However, when overloading it with characters beyond the size of 64 KB, the comment gets stored in the WP database instead of cache (I think that is where it goes). The leads to it executing every single time the overflow comments are read (often). When the script is stored more than once, it will freeze the site. No scrolling. No functioning links. No useability. 
    - Vulnerability types: XXS
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.1
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trezzan/RepoBoi/master/XSS.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: Find  a section to comment on a page or post. Fields other than body don't really matter. Insert the script to alert, and overload it with characters. Submit and wait for the site to die slowly. It is important to already be approved to comment or the admin will easily deny. Post something simple first, then go in for the kill!
  - [ ] Affected source code:
    - MySQL database up to v.5.5.41

4. Press This CSRF DoS **(ATTEMPTED:FAILED)**
  - [ ] Summary: Creating a file on a secondary server and sending a link to the admin account crashes their WP site. This can be done in the comments to ensure that they are logged in. The file has commands that (if repeated enough) will DDoS the site and bring it down for a while trying to complete the URL command. 
    - Vulnerability types: XXS
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.13
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: none; all attempts unsuccessful
  - [ ] Steps to recreate:
  -On an external server, create a large text file with the command:
perl -e 'print "<>"x28000000' > foo.txt
- Next, create a file called dos.html on the external server with enough
entries to fill the connection pool of the WordPress server, as follows:
```
<img src='http://<wp
server>/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=http%3A%2F%2F<external
server>%2Ffoo.txt&url-scan-submit=Scan&a=b'>
```
- [repeat as many times as preferrerd]
- (replace <wp server> with the WordPress server address and <external
server> with the external server)
- Now have a logged in admin visit dos.html. The server will be down for a
while.
  
  
  [ ] Affected source code: entire site crash

## Notes

- [ ] Troubles: 
  - Understanding how to correctly initiate and manage the vagrant framework was a big challenge. Now that i know how it works, it seems like very powerful tool that i can imagine security researchers clamor for. 
  - Attempting the CSRF DDoS was difficult. I have not spend enough time in 'hacker' mode to understand how, why, and when certain actions work. I was unsure why perl was required to pull off the file creation. Further, I could not get an effective link to publish. By that I mean I DID publish a link to the page, but the link was inneffective. I think the creation of it was incorrect, but I ran out of time trying to figure it out.
